================== NOTES FROM THE AUTHOR ==================

Hello! Thank you for choosing to download this product! As you may know, this product is in it’s early development phase and every single piece of feedback I can get would be amazing! :)

This is a Boeing 777-300ER, the most largest aircraft of it’s kind. It’s a wide-body aircraft capable of crossing the Atlantic with over 350 people on board. 

My goal is to bring this into X-Plane as a freeware product. So basically, in a couple of years, you could be able to fly a Boeing 777-300ER inside of the X-plane which is fully realistic. Even though the published aircraft may pretty plain, I am currently researching and planning the cockpit thoroughly.

================== INSTALLATION ==================

1. First, locate your X-plane 10/11 home folder. It should contain the ‘Aircraft’ 		folder.

2. Open it and locate the ‘Heavy Metal’ folder, if you’ve changed it or it’s not there, 	just make a new folder or select another folder - it doesn’t matter.

3. Locate the B777-300ER folder that this text file is in. Right next of the ‘Information’ 	folder should be the Boeing 777-300ER folder, open it and make sure it’s 		filled 	with cluttered files and one saying ‘liveries’.

4. Drag that folder into the ‘Heavy Metal’ folder or whatever you’ve chosen.

5. Start up X-plane and you should see the aircraft in the selection menu.

================== CHANGELOG ==================

I’ve made many improvements to the exterior of the aircraft!
Here they are!
